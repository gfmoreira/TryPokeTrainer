## Try PokÃ©mon Trainer

A simple website, landing page, for programming practice ðŸ˜Š and/or knowledge improvement.

## Concept

The user can access and make a "registration", putting the name of the trainer, his age and the city of origin of the Pokemon universe, then searches, by region, the list of Pokemon available to be added to his team.

Below the list is your team. To add correctly, you first need to click on the slot in the list and then on the pokÃ©mon you want to include.

## Technologies to be used

```bash
- Javascript / Typescript
- Next / React (Typescript)

-- Below are some that will not be applied at the beginning of the project, but will be added at some point. --

At the moment we still have few PokÃ©mon added, soon we will have more to the list and improvements, remembering that the code is in a development branch.
